# MENTAL-DISORDER-DATASET-ANAYLSIS

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing a Mental Disorder Dataset to understand the patterns, correlations, and factors influencing mental health conditions.
The goal is to gain insights that can help identify early indicators of mental disorders and support mental health awareness through data-driven analysis.

# Objectives
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the mental disorder dataset.
To identify key factors contributing to different mental health conditions.
To visualize the distribution of disorders and their relation to demographic or lifestyle variables.
To prepare the dataset for potential predictive modeling or machine learning applications.

#Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values using appropriate imputation techniques.
Encoded categorical variables (e.g., gender, stress levels).
Scaled numerical features for analysis.
Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns.

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed various analyses to uncover insights:
Distribution plots for mental disorders by age and gender.
Correlation heatmaps to examine relationships between stress, sleep, and disorder types.

# Tools & Libraries
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

#Results & Discussion
This analysis highlights the importance of lifestyle and stress management in mental health.
The findings may support awareness campaigns or contribute to early identification frameworks for mental disorders.

#Disclaimer
This dataset and analysis are intended for research and educational purposes only.
They should not be used for clinical diagnosis or medical decision-making.<img width="887" height="497" alt="LEO" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/760de172-d432-43d1-96cb-336449e36924" />
